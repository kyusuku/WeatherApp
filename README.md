# 🌦 WeatherApp 🌍  

**WeatherApp** is a simple JavaScript-based application that provides weather data based on the user's location or a specified city. The app uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch weather information and displays it in an easy-to-read format, including temperature, weather condition, and other related data. This project was created as a **personal project** before starting **The Odin Project**, showcasing my skills in **API integration**, **asynchronous JavaScript**, and **UI design**.

## 🚀 Try It Out  

👉 You can test the **WeatherApp** here: [WeatherApp](https://kyusuku.github.io/WeatherApp/)  

⚠️ **Note:** Since I am using a free plan for web hosting, the website may take around **30 to 60 seconds** to activate when first loaded. After that, it should work normally.
